Mex implementation of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, adopted from https://github.com/siddharth-agrawal/DBSCAN

Compile dbScanMex.cpp in Matlab to get executable mex file.

Inputs are:
X: A M x N matrix where M is the number of points and N the dimensionality
eps: A distance threshold 
min_pts: Minimum number of neighbors for a cluster basepoint
verbose: optional boolean indicator for console output (default is true)

The output is:
out: An M x 1 array of class labels. 0 labels don't belong to any cluster and can be considered outliers.
