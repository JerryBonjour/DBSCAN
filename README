C++ implementation of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, originally adopted from https://github.com/siddharth-agrawal/DBSCAN but completely rewritten.
Uses [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) for kd-tree radius search.

Inputs are:
points: A M x N matrix where M is the number of points and N the dimensionality
eps: A distance threshold 
min_pts: Minimum number of neighbors for a cluster basepoint
verbose: optional boolean indicator for console output (default is true)

The output is:
cluster: An M x 1 vector of class labels. 0 labels don't belong to any cluster and can be considered outliers.
